Execute the commands below:

> [!NOTE]

```
git clone git@github.com:jfmonsa/AtlasBooks-front.git
cd AtlasBooks-front

## 2. Contribute

In general, this project follows the [Ship, Show, Ask](https://martinfowler.com/articles/ship-show-ask.html) methodology.

### General Concerns

- Make isolated commits as a good practice. This helps in tracking changes and rolling back if necessary.

### Naming Convention for Pull Requests

- For each feature you want to work on, create a branch with the appropriate prefix:

  - `feature/` for new features
  - `update/` for updates to existing features
  - `fix/` for bug fixes

  Follow this with a descriptive branch name, e.g., `feature/add-user-authentication`.

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. Ensure your branch is up-to-date with the `main` branch.
2. Open a pull request with a clear and descriptive title.
3. Provide a detailed description of the changes youâ€™ve made.
4. Request reviews from relevant team members.
